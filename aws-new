*******************AWS******************************
Scenario-based: You're tasked with migrating a company's on-premise database to the cloud using AWS.  What factors would you consider when designing the migration strategy, and what AWS services might you utilize?
**Factors to Consider:**
    * **Database size and type:**  Consider data volume and compatibility with AWS database services (RDS, Aurora, DynamoDB).
    * **Downtime tolerance:**  Plan for minimal disruption during migration (e.g., using AWS Database Migration Service).
    * **Security:**  Ensure proper IAM roles and access controls for the migrated database.
    * **Cost optimization:**  Choose the most cost-effective service based on usage patterns (e.g., reserved instances for predictable workloads).
**Potential AWS Services:**
    * **AWS Database Migration Service (DMS):** simplifies database migration to various AWS database options.
    * **Amazon S3:**  for temporary storage of database backups during migration.
    * **Amazon EC2:**  for launching temporary instances to facilitate the migration process.
    * **Amazon VPC:**  to create a secure virtual network for the migrated database.

2. Security: How would you implement a secure and scalable architecture for a web application on AWS?

Here's a possible approach to secure and scalable architecture:

* **Use Amazon VPC:**  Isolate your application resources in a private network with security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic.
* **Implement IAM roles:**  Assign least privilege access to resources for different application components.
* **Utilize Amazon S3 for static content:**  Offload static files (images, JS) to S3 for scalability and content delivery network (CDN) integration with CloudFront.
* **Load balance with Elastic Load Balancing (ELB):**  Distribute traffic across multiple EC2 instances for high availability and scalability. 
* **Automate scaling with Auto Scaling:**  Automatically scale resources (EC2 instances) based on predefined metrics for optimal performance.
* **Encrypt data at rest and in transit:**  Use AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to manage encryption keys for data security.

3. Cost Optimization: A client complains their AWS bill is higher than expected. Describe your approach to identify cost-saving opportunities.

Here's how you might identify cost-saving opportunities:

* **Analyze AWS Cost Explorer:**  Identify the services and resources consuming the most cost.
* **Review EC2 instances:**  Are you using the right instance types for your workload? Consider switching to more cost-effective options (e.g., spot instances for non-critical tasks).
* **Optimize storage usage:**  Move infrequently accessed data to cheaper storage classes in S3 (e.g., Glacier for archival data).
* **Utilize Reserved Instances (RIs):**  If you have consistent resource usage, commit to RIs for significant cost savings.
* **Enable AWS Billing alerts:**  Set up alerts to notify you of unexpected spikes in spending.

4. Service-specific: Briefly explain the difference between Amazon S3 and Amazon EBS storage options. When would you choose one over the other?

**Amazon S3:**

* **Object storage:** Designed for storing large amounts of unstructured data (e.g., backups, logs, archives).
* **Highly durable and scalable:** Offers high availability and data redundancy across multiple locations.
* **Pay-per-use model:** You only pay for the storage you use, making it cost-effective for variable data volumes.

**Amazon EBS:**

* **Block storage:** Designed for attaching persistent storage to EC2 instances for applications.
* **High performance:** Ideal for applications requiring frequent disk access and fast I/O operations.
* **Ephemeral:** Data on EBS volumes is lost when the EC2 instance terminates. 

**Choosing between S3 and EBS:**

* Choose S3 for: Backups, logs, static website content, infrequently accessed data.
* Choose EBS for: Database storage, application data requiring frequent access, boot volumes for EC2 instances.  

5. Conceptual:  How does the concept of "fault tolerance" apply when building cloud systems on AWS?

Fault tolerance refers to a system's ability to withstand and recover from failures without significant downtime or data loss. In AWS, you can achieve fault tolerance through several mechanisms:

* **Redundancy:**  Distribute your application across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) within a region to ensure redundancy if one AZ experiences an outage.
* **Auto Scaling:**  Automatically spin up new instances to replace failing ones, maintaining application availability.
* **Elastic Load Balancing:**  Distribute traffic across healthy instances and automatically reroute traffic away from failing ones.
* **High Availability (HA) databases:**  Use services like Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments for automatic failover to a standby instance in case of a primary database failure.
