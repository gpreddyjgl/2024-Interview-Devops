Explain the difference between Terraform's "count" and "for_each" meta-arguments when defining multiple instances of a resource.

Explain the key features of Terraform?

Declarative Language: Terraform uses a declarative language called HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) to define infrastructure resources. This makes it easier to understand and manage infrastructure as code.
Multi-Cloud Support: Terraform supports many cloud providers, including AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and more. It also supports on-premises data centers.
Resource Management: Terraform enables you to manage infrastructure resources such as virtual machines, networks, and storage.
State Management: Terraform keeps track of the state of infrastructure resources, allowing you to see the current state of infrastructure and manage changes.
Modularity: Terraform allows you to create reusable modules, making managing and provisioning complex infrastructure easier.

How does Terraform ensure the consistency of infrastructure configurations?

What is the difference between Docker images and Docker containers?
How do you optimize Docker images for size and performance?
i)Use multi-stage builds, Minimize layers: Each RUN, COPY, or ADD command creates a new layer in your image. Combine these commands where possible to reduce the number of layers, using chaining commands (&&) in a single RUN instruction.
ii)Clean up in the same layer: Remove unnecessary files created by package managers within the same Dockerfile command.
